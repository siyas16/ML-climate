# Studying Effects of Climate Change on Bird Species Interactions

We will be using a dataset we have found on Bird Species distribution to study how interactions have changed between species as climate conditions have changed. The dataset includes data from breeding and non-breeding seasons in America, giving us the potential to see how breeding habits have changed as well.
