# Studying Effects of Climate Change on Bird Species Interactions: Forcasting interspecies competition using counterfactural models and machine learning

Climate change is reshaping ecosystems by changing bird species distributions and interactions. Our project investigates whether rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events have influenced bird species competitions specifically those with overlapping ecological niches like food based competition, habitat based competition, or migration/breeding timing conflicts. Using long-term bird speices data from eBird, we quantify bird species interaction patterns over time and integrate habitat preference data from the Audubon Climate Reports. We also integrate historical climate data from NOAA to investigate the impact of enviornmental changes on species interactions. 

We use a combination of ecological modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze trends of bird species interactions and predict future shifts in bird species interactions. First, we apply time series and spatial clustering methods to detect significant changes in bird species interactions. Next, we use causal inference to distinguish correlation from causation in climate-driven changes. Lastly, we use machine learning techniques like RNNs to forcast future competitive bird species dynamics.
