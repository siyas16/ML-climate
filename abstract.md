# Studying Effects of Climate Change on Bird Species Interactions: Forcasting interspecies competition using counterfactural models and machine learning

Climate change is reshaping ecosystems by changing bird species distributions, food webs, and interspecies interactions. Our project investigates whether rising temperatures and their effect on salmon population have influenced bird species competition, specifically those with overlapping ecological niches like food based competition and habitat based competition. Using long-term bird species data from eBird, we quantify bird species interaction patterns over time. To understand the effect of climate change on fish populations, we used data from the Pacific Salmon Foundation. We also integrate historical climate data from NOAA to investigate the impact of environmental changes on species interactions. 

We use a combination of ecological modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze trends of bird species interactions and predict future shifts in bird species interactions. Initially, we began with non-causal methods to capture the interactions between different variables. Then, we used causal inference to distinguish correlation from causation in climate-driven changes. Lastly, we used predictive modeling to forecast future dynamics in avian competition under different climate scenarios.
