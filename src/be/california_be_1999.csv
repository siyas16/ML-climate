No wind, cloudless. --Coverage: Melissa Kelly and I contributed to the annual Lake Cachuma Bald Eagle count.  Ours was one of 10 or so groups ferried to various portions of the lake.  We covered the east portion of lake from Santa Ynez Point S to Rancho San Fernando Rey as shown on the map.  The position of the boom line is approximate.  Our hike bordered a cattle pasture, but further to the SE it became an E facing oak woodland with a healthy understory of Salvia, Baccharis, Toxicodendron, Ceanothus.  We observed at several points along the 1.0 mi. hike. The summary of most of the waterfowl occurred at 1030-1130 from a point immediately N of the R. San Fernando Rey HQ. We were able to look nearly a mile to the E of our S’most observations point.  An Eastern Phoebe was heard and soon seen by both Melissa and myself at approx. 0930.  It was singing from a bare snag 3-4m high in a live oak at the edge of the lake.  See map.  The spot as within 30m N of 3 large dead tree snags.  Original notes mention 1 Black-bellied Plover  ""call heard"". Because there are no other records away from the coast, this record requires more substantiation.--Other notes from Lake Cachuma:  Near Santa Ynez Point, Dave Compton saw a Swamp Sparrow.  On the ride back to the marina, we stopped at Sta. Cruz Bay and saw one White-faced Ibis; two individuals have been seen recently.  On the return boat trip from Santa Ynez Point to the Marina we saw an approximately even distribution of Clark’s to Western Grebes, perhaps a few more Clark’s.  Later, Dave Compton went out on the lake and saw ~700 grebes, nearly all of which were Western.  Approx. 15 Herring Gulls were at the marina as was 1 Great-tailed Grackle.  Liz Mason reports that 5 White Pelican have been seen recently on the lake.--<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/91666839@N00/53258921179/in/dateposted-public/"" title=""Screen Shot 2023-10-14 at 7.21.49 PM""><img src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53258921179_3a22cf682e_w.jpg"" alt=""Screen Shot 2023-10-14 at 7.21.49 PM"" /></a>--Click on image to enlarge it.",imm.

[More details published in NAB.] The Aechmorphus grebes were estimate by blocks of 100s, then distributed to species by several random efforts to find % of each.

This was during a time we (P&D Consutants) had a 2-year contract with the MWD, to assist them in monitoring (per their facility operations' permit conditions) the annual cutting of vegetation below the ordinary high-water mark at LM. This cutting was done during the non-breeding season (per permit regulations), and was performed by trained fire fighting crews that were inmates from the Norco and Bautista prisons in Riverside County. There would usually be one crew truck from each prison, with a fire captain with each truck overseeing the cutting. (No Correction officers present, as these were considered ""low risk inmates"", which were serving time for usually drug-related charges, and not ""more serious"" crimes, as we were told). The vegetation being cut was usually tamarisk (salt-cedar). They would allow the pre-existing mature native trees (primarily willows) to remain, although they'd cut saplings and the lower limbs of the mature trees. The primary purpose of this program was to eliminate or minimize potential nesting habitat for California Gnatcatchers and Bell's Vireos in the elevations that MWD could store water (brought in from the Colorado River Aquaduct I believe). The idea that removing potential breeding habitat for these birds, below the ""ordinary high-water mark"", would minimize the potential ""take"" of the two federally endangered/threatened species (if these species happened to have active nests in habitat that was to become inundated by water being pumped into LM).  It would normally take about four months to finish veg removal around the entire shoreline of LM. ----On this particular date the weather was: ""High, thin clouds, variable (45-75% cover); chilly NE winds at 10-25 mph, after 1000 hrs. Temps in the mid 50s (deg. F), to 60F max."" ----Abbreviations used:  LM = Lake Matthews; MWD = Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.","At least a very probable. Definitely an eagle. Large, dark (not an adult Bald Eagle), long wing span, very slow wing beats versus a RTHA (and maybe even TUVU or OSPR). Not the best view angle (going mostly away), flying west along south shoreline, into a slight glare. So not able to get good color contrast. Thought I could see whitish mottling on underparts. Would be the first I've seen so far this winter here (a few regularly winter at LM of course)."
